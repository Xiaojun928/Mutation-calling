# Mutation-calling

Mutation-accumulation (MA) experiments followed by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) are considered an approximately unbiased method for mutation determination, as this approach allows all but lethal mutations to accumulate (Ref).

This pipeline was contributed by **Ying Sun** (fuhuisuen@gmail.com) to perform mutation calling using the data from MA/WGS.
